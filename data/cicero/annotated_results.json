Some people are afraid to do it, but you say it's something smart. <speaker2> Yeah, it is very safe. And we certainly recommend that you use your own bank's website. So go to the bank, talk to the consumer service representatives there. It's the best way to find out how safe it is and how easy... <speaker1> And how much time do you think you could save, Carolyn, by doing that? <speaker2> If you're making transfers, or checking your statements, you can save up to an hour. <speaker1> The second tip is online grocers. Now, that's really not for everyone, but you actually go grocery shopping online. <speaker2> That's exactly what you do. If you are the type of person that wants to read every label and look at every piece of fruit, it's probably not for you.
